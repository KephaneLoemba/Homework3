# K.L. Apps | Password Generator v.1.0

***Hello reviewer!***
Here's a password generator that I've created!

This simple password generator uses some basic Javascript functionality paired with 'click' event listeners to provide a responsive password generating application.

The app allows the user to select the criteria that will define the generated password. These parameters are:\

    -Password length
    -Password includes uppercase characters
    -Password includes lowercase characters
    -Password includes special characters
    -Password includes numeric characters

***Restrictions:***
    The user must select a password length between [8, 128] characters.
    Also, the user must select AT LEAST ONE character type preference.

Enjoy!
